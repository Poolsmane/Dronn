1. Past Performance: The Bidder or its OEM {themselves or through re-seller(s)} should have supplied same or
similar Category Products for 40% of bid quantity, in at least one of the last three Financial years before the bid
opening date to any Central / State Govt Organization / PSU. Copies of relevant contracts (proving supply of
cumulative order quantity in any one financial year) to be submitted along with bid in support of quantity
supplied in the relevant Financial year. In case of bunch bids, the category related to primary product having
highest bid value should meet this criterion.
2. Reverse Auction would be conducted amongst first 50% of the technically qualified bidders arranged in the
order of prices from lowest to highest. Number of sellers eligible for participating in RA would be rounded off to
next higher integer value if number of technically qualified bidders is odd (e.g. if 7 bids are technically qualified,
then RA will be conducted amongst L-1 to L-4). In case number of technically qualified bidders are 2 or 3, RA will
be between all without any elimination. If Buyer has chosen to split the bid amongst N sellers, then minimum N
sellers would be taken to RA round. In case Primary products of only one OEM are left in contention for
participation in RA based on lowest 50% bidders qualifying for RA, the number of sellers qualifying for RA would
be increased to get at least products of one more OEM (directly participated or through its reseller) if available.
Further, if bid(s) of any seller(s) eligible for MSE preference is / are coming within price band of 15% of Non MSE
L-1 or if bid of any seller(s) eligible for Make in India preference is / are coming within price band of 20% of non
MII L-1, then such MSE / Make in India seller shall also be allowed to participate in the RA process.
